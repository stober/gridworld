This package contains implementations of discrete mdps known as
gridworlds that are convenient for testing reinforcement learning
algorithms. Some visualization is provided, along with a few other
mdps drawn from the literature on reinforcement learning.

Note: This package now depends on https://github.com/stober/utils for sparse feature generation.
